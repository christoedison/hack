       * The worldâ€™s population is constantly increasing. To accommodate everyone, we need to build modern &
sustainable cities. For all of us to survive and prosper, we need new, intelligent urban planning that creates safe,
affordable, and resilient cities with green and culturally inspiring living conditions.

       * Clean water and sanitation are fundamental human rights. Without them, several people die each year, and the
economies of entire nations are at risk. The global economy suffers billions of losses yearly due to a lack of basic
water and sanitation. No one flourishes without access to these essential needs, yet billions of people worldwide
live without them.

       * To ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Our everyday lives depend on
reliable and affordable energy to work smoothly and to develop equitably. A well-established energy system
supports all sectors like businesses, medicine, education to agriculture, infrastructure, communications and high-
technology. Conversely, the lack of access to energy supplies and transformation systems is a constraint to human
and economic development.
